# Netflix landing page

This is github repository for the netflix landing page clone. I have changed name from "Netflix" to "Tenflix" :)

This is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript without any framework.

You can see the live demo [here](https://isaif.github.io/tenflix/)

## How assets were made?

All the assets can be found in the assets directory.

### Inkscape

I have used Inkscape to create the following assets

- logo-full.svg i.e. "Tenflix" logo
- logo.svg i.e. "T" logo

### Gimp

Gimp was used to create and modify some images.
These images has file with two extension, ".xcf" and ".jpg" or ".png".

The ".xcf" file is Gimp file.

The ".jpg" and ".png" is the exported file from Gimp.

- movie-pic.jpg is the background image of hero section
- tv-new.png is the image in the first section
- mobile.png is the image in the second section
- devices-new.png is the image in third section

### Joker video

I took a video from a youtube and made a 11 sec clip using an online video editor.

## What can be improved?

The images can be optimised and accessibility can be improved.
